// Rules relaxed with a documented reason:
//
// 'list' — the demo breadcrumb component renders `<ol class="breadcrumb swiper-wrapper">`
//           (a Swiper carousel applied to a breadcrumb) on 00-modal.html. axe flags this
//           STATICALLY: the Swiper wrapper markup makes the <ol> have children that aren't
//           plain <li>. This is a demo-only pattern; index.html has no such markup. Disabling
//           is scoped to tolerate the demo breadcrumb, not a real content list.
//           (Earlier this was wrongly attributed to runtime Swiper role injection — it's static.)
//
// NOTE: 'aria-input-field-name' was previously disabled to hide unlabeled form-wrap inputs
//       on the modal / 00-modal pages. That was a real, fixable defect — the inputs now carry
//       <label>s (see _modal.pug / 00-modal.pug), so the rule is enforced again.
